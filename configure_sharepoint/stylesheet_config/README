Option 4 [My Favorite for Quick & Easy Applications] +SP-Editor / Chrome Only



[Download SP Editor plugin from the Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sp-editor/ecblfcmjnbbgaojblcpmjoamegpbodhd)

Once you have the plugin installed and navigated to your SharePoint site, hit F12 to open the developer tools bar.

Click on the SharePoint tab and then click ScriptLinks. Here you can enter the sequence number to order your CSS references or JavaScript links. You also enter a site collection relative url from JavaScript only. After you enter that information, Click on the Add ScriptLink dropdown and select either current web or site collection

Pros:
Super Fast & Easy
Quickly apply CSS or JavaScript to a site or web (sub site) using the browser

Cons:
Requires Chrome [only a con if your organization doesnâ€™t allow you to have Chrome] Manual process, not scriptable or repeatable.
