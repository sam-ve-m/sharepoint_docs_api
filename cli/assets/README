To access and develop the mobile view of your SharePoint website, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Mobile View**: Go to your SharePoint site, click on the gear icon in the top right corner, and select "Site settings." Under "Look and Feel," click on "Mobile." Make sure the "Enable mobile view" option is checked.

2. **Access Mobile View**: To preview your site in mobile view, append "?mobile=1" to the end of your site's URL. For example: `https://your-site.sharepoint.com?mobile=1`. This will render your site in a mobile-friendly layout.

3. **Configure Viewports**: SharePoint uses a responsive design framework called "Device Channels" to adapt its layout to different devices. You can configure device channels by going to "Site settings" > "Look and Feel" > "Device Channels." Here, you can define different channels for various devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, phone).

4. **Customize Mobile Components**: To customize the mobile view, you'll need to use SharePoint's built-in features or write custom CSS/JavaScript code. Some common customizations include:
	* Hiding or showing specific web parts or elements.
	* Adjusting font sizes, colors, or layouts.
	* Creating custom mobile-friendly templates for pages or lists.

To achieve these customizations, you can use the following approaches:

a. **SharePoint Designer**: A free tool from Microsoft that allows you to create custom SharePoint solutions, including mobile views. You can use it to create custom page layouts, web parts, and more.

b. **CSS/JavaScript Files**: You can upload custom CSS or JavaScript files to your SharePoint site to override the default styles or behaviors. These files can be uploaded to the "Style Library" or "Scripts" library in your site.

c. **SPFx (SharePoint Framework)**: A set of tools and libraries for building custom SharePoint solutions. SPFx allows you to create custom web parts, extensions, and more, using modern web development technologies like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
